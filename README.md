# Project 1935 [On hold]
Project 1935 is a real time multiplayer grand strategy set in 1935 onwards. It is in development using the Unity game engine and the C# programming language. It currently utilises UNET for the networking, but when I start working on it again I plan on moving completely to my own networking using C# .NET sockets or something similar.

**The project is currently on hold as the scale of the project means it takes a lot more time than some smaller and more manageable, projects that I can work on instead. So although it seems abandoned, I have every intention of working on the project.**

*The most recent commit leaves the game in a broken state, I believe the commit on Jun 27 was the last working one, either way it lacks actual gameplay, more just the networking structure within UNET*
