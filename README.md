# [On hold] 1935
A real time multiplayer grand strategy set in 1935. In development using the Unity Game Engine and the C# Programming Language.

* Currently on hold due to the scale of the project, will continue work in the future, but aiming to complete a bunch of smaller, more manageable projects before then.

The state it is in is currently broken, I believe the commit on Jun 27 was the last working one.
